### 4. Capstone Project: Insider Threats
**Overview**:  
Created a short film highlighting insider threats and their mitigation strategies.

I have this film posted on Youtube it's about 7 minutes long and goes over how anyone, even the most loyal, can be your worst nightmare.
I used storytelling and a bit of creative audio to create this piece and tell a story of how someone within an organization can be a threat. 
[This Video Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agszZwqljro&t=4s)

**Key Features**:  
- Researched behavioral indicators and real-world case studies.  
- Combined technical research with creative storytelling to raise awareness.
- Enforces least privilege and User Behavior Analysis
